## FAQ

### Q: Package not found even if it exists in the remote repository

Make sure you choosed correct `PLATFORM_STRING_MODE`.

If package is not bound to the architecture or Linux distro this context info must be passed down by the `PLATFORM_STRING_MODE`.

### Q: Package conflict if I want to build my project by second build type

If you want to use same cache path for Release and Debug build type
you must ensure that the package differ between Debug/Release build config.

If you have a package that has a same content for Debug and Release you need to
use `NO_DEBUG ON` in `BA_PACKAGE_LIBRARY` otherwise the conflict occure.
