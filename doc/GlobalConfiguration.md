# Package Tracker Global Configuration

Package Tracker uses a [CMCONF] - CMake-lib global configuration module to store and retrieve settings that apply to all packages that
belong to the same System.

[CMCONF] expects the system name to be set by `CMCONF_INIT_SYSTEM(<system_name>)` to be able to get
predefined settings by `CMCONF_GET(<setting_name>)`.

The Configuration is represented as standard Config.cmake file which is installed by symlink
to [CMake User Package Registry]. [CMCONF Example] can be found in [CMCONF] repository.

[CMake User Package Registry]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-packages.7.html

## CMCONF Variables

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_USE | If set to ON the local Package repository is used. The path to the local Package Repository is set by BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_PATH or by ENV variable BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_PATH. If set to OFF the remote URI scheme is used. |
| BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_PATH | Absolute Path to the local Package Repository. Used if BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_USE is set to ON. If ENV variable BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_PATH is set it is used instead of this CMCONF setting. Resulting value is passed to URI_TEMPLATE setting variable as "file://<local_path>/package/<GIT_PATH>/<PACKAGE_GROUP_NAME>/<ARCHIVE_NAME>" |
| BA_PACKAGE_URI_REVISION | Git revision to use when accessing Package Repository. Used if BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_USE is set to OFF. |
| BA_PACKAGE_URI_TEMPLATE_REMOTE | [CMake-lib] template to construct URI to download package from remote Package Registry. Passed to URI_TEMPLATE setting variable. Used if BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_USE is set to OFF. |
| BA_PACKAGE_HTTP_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER | HTTP Authorization header to use when accessing Package Repository. Used if BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_USE is set to OFF. |

## Environment Variables

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_PATH | Absolute Path to the local Package Repository. If set, Package Tracker behaves as if BA_PACKAGE_LOCAL_USE is set to ON and the local path is set to the value from this ENV variable. |
